    "# 1. Framing the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "[Home Credit](https://www.homecredit.net) is a multinational company with a simples business model: lend money. Generally, to customers with little or no credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the cornerstones of their business model is the **predictive power of the data they possess**. They are making some of this data available online aiming to unlock its full potential, *a.k.a. deliver value from it*. In our case, we got a sample of this data to apply the data science/machine learning process on it with the intention to extract value from it and practice our learnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ROC-AUC Score. This project is a deliverable from the [Let's Code Data Science Degree](https://letscode.com.br/python-e-dados) Machine Learning III module.\n",
    "2. This is also a Learning-oriented Project, I intend to **experiment on various aspects of Machine Learning** - and have some fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The train dataset will be splitted into **80% of a final train dataset** and **20% in a validation dataset**. The model that provides the best ROC-AUC in the validation dataset will be chosen - as it is the one with more chances of producing the best results in the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ROC-AUC?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the most balanced and robust performance measurement indicator in classification problems. Simply put, the closer the ROC-AUC is from 100%, the better the model is at distinguishing between classes: in our case, distinguishing a good applicant to a laon from a bad one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the solution will be used\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a two-column .csv file, containing the **SK_ID_CURR**, which is the Loan ID, and **TARGET**, which is the probability that the applicant will have payment difficulties. This will be used to calculate the final ROC-AUC Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no baseline solution or current KPI. \n",
    "1. This challenge is derived from a Kaggle Competition. The top-scoring model achieved a ROC-AUC of 82% using the complete Dataset.\n",
    "2. A Dummy Classifier (without any learning/training) would achieve a ROC-AUC of 50% - this migh be used as a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Supervised Batch Learning. The model will learn offline from labeled instances using all the available data to classify new instances into two classes: good borrowers who will pay their debts and borrowers who will give the bank some headache.\n",
    "\n",
