# Machine Learning - Home Credit Default Risk

*Predicting customer credit default with Machine Learning: a model garden exploration.*

# Project
## ðŸ“° Intro
[Home Credit](https://www.homecredit.net) is a multinational company with a simple business model: lend money. Generally, to customers with little or no credit history.

One of the cornerstones of their business model is the **predictive power of the data they possess**. They are making some of this data available online aiming to unlock its full potential. In our case, we got a sample of this data to apply the data mining process on it with the intention to extract value.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The main goal is to use data to predict if an applicant will have trouble to pay their debt. This objective is cascaded into:

1. Creating a Machine Learning model that is good at distinguishing between classes: in our case, distinguishing a good applicant to a loan from a bad one.
2. This is also a Learning-oriented Project, I intend to **experiment on various aspects of Machine Learning** - and have some fun.
